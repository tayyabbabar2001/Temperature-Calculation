# Temperature-Calculation
The Temperature Sensation Analyzer is a C++ program designed to provide a general description of how a given temperature might feel to a person. Users input the temperature in Fahrenheit, and the program then calculates the corresponding temperature in Celsius and offers a descriptive sensation based on the temperature range.

**Features:**

Temperature Input: The program prompts the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Temperature Conversion: The analyzer converts the input temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the conversion formula (temp - 32) * (5/9).

Temperature Sensation: Based on the converted temperature, the program offers descriptive sensations to describe how the temperature might feel:

"Too Cold" for temperatures below 15°C.
"Pleasant" for temperatures between 15°C and 25°C (inclusive).
"Hot" for temperatures between 26°C and 35°C (inclusive).
"Too Hot" for temperatures above 35°C.
**How to Use:**

Run the program.
Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit when prompted by the console.
The program will process the input, convert it to Celsius, and provide a descriptive temperature sensation.
**Note:**

The Temperature Sensation Analyzer assumes the user will input valid numerical values for the temperature.
The program offers a general sense of how a given temperature might feel and does not take into account individual preferences or geographical variations.
